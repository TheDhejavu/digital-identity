# Digital-identity
The traditional identity systems of today are fragmented, insecure, and exclusive. Blockchain enables more secure management and storage of digital identities by providing unified, inter-operable, and tamper-proof infrastructure with key benefits to enterprises and users. This is a simple implementation of a <strong>digital identity system</strong> using blockchain technlogoy and it's built on IBM hyperledger fabric using smart contract coupled with an API for interfacing with the fabric sdk and a client application built with React for performing variety of actions.
